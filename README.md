# P5JS-Object-Oriented-Bouncing-Balls
This program demonstrates re-use of a "bubble" class to allow the creation of multiple unique bubbles that then "bounce" around the screen. An interesting bug was also addressed in which a bubble will get stuck in the edge of the canvas if it hits a corner "just right". A solution to this problem was explained here: http://lagers.org.uk/blog/?p=122
